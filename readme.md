## File System Access API

The main goal of this project is to showcase the **[File System Access API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/)**.

This API allows a web app to access local files. That means files can be opened and saved directly in the browser.

## File Handling
To make it even more convenient to open and save files, this app also uses the **[File Handling API](https://web.dev/file-handling/)**. If installed the app can register itself as a handler for markdown files. That means markdown files can be opened directly in the app from the file explorer.

## Installable PWA
This webapp is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) and can be installed on your device.  
It uses a webapp manifest (generated by [Vite PWA Plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/)) to present itself as an installable PWA to the browser.

## Offline support
It also comes with a service worker (generated by [WorkboxJS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/)) to cache all assets and make the app available offline.  
Furthermore, all downloaded audio files are cached and can be used offline.

## AI
This app uses a couple of AI models to provide additional features. All the models run directly in the browser and don't require any server communication.
